## Nooks Watch Party Project

In this takehome project, we want to understand your:
- ability to build something non-trivial from scratch
- comfort picking up unfamiliar technologies
- architectural decisions, abstractions, and rigor

We want to respect your time, so please try not to spend more than 5 hours on this. We know that this is a challenging task & you are under time pressure and will keep that in mind when evaluating your solution.

### Instructions

To run the app simply "npm i" and then "npm start"

### Problem
Your task is to build a collaborative ‚ÄúWatch Party‚Äù app that lets a distributed group of users watch youtube videos together. The frontend should be written in Typescript (we have a skeleton for you set up) and the backend should be written in Node.JS. The app should support two main pages:

- `/create` **Create a new session**
    - by giving it a name and a youtube video link. After creating a session `ABC`, you should be automatically redirected to the page `/watch` page for that session
- `/watch/:sessionId` **Join an existing session**
    
    *‚ö†Ô∏è The player must be **synced for all users at all times** no matter when they join the party*
    
    - **Playing/pausing/seek** the video. When someone plays/pauses the video or jumps to a certain time in the video, this should update for everyone in the session
    - **Realtime** **Switching** the video. When someone switches the session to a different youtube video, this should update for everyone
    - **Late to the party**... Everything should stay synced if a user joins the session late (e.g. if the video was already playing, the new user should see it playing at the correct time)
        
### Assumptions

- This app obviously **doesn‚Äôt need to be production-ready**, but you should at least be aware of any issues you may encounter in more real-world scenarios.
- We gave you all of the frontend UX you‚Äôll need in the [starter repo](https://github.com/NooksApp/nooks-fullstack-takehome), including skeleton pages for the `create` and `watch` routes, so you can focus on implementing the core backend functionality & frontend video playing logic for the app.
- You should probably use **websockets** to keep state synchronized between multiple users.

You will need to embed a Youtube video directly in the website. In our skeleton code we use [react-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player), but feel free to use another library or use the [Youtube IFrame API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) directly.

In order to sync the video, you‚Äôll need to know when any user plays, pauses, or seeks in their own player and transmit that information to everyone else. In order to get play, pause, and seek events you can use:
1. [YouTube iFrame API - Events](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Events)
2. Build your own custom controls for play, pause & seek. If you choose  this option, make sure the controls UX works very similarly to youtube‚Äôs standard controls (e.g. play/pause button and a slider for seek)

### Required Functionality

- [x] **Creating a session**. Any user should be able to create a session to watch a given Youtube video.
- [x] **Joining a session**. Any user should be able to join a session created by another user using the shareable session link.
- [x] **Playing/pausing** the video. When a participant pauses the video, it should pause for everyone. When a participant plays the video, it should start playing for everyone.
- [x] **‚ÄúSeek‚Äù**. When someone jumps to a certain time in the video it should jump to that time for everyone.
- [x] **Late to the party**... Everything should stay synced even if a user joins the watch party late (e.g. the video is already playing)
- [x] **Player controls.** All the player controls (e.g. play, pause, and seek) should be intuitive and behave as expected. For play, pause & seek operations you can use the built-in YouTube controls or disable the YouTube controls and build your own UI (including a slider for the seek operation)
